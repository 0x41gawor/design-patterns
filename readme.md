# Design Patterns

[source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog)

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

## Classification of patterns

### Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- Factory Method
- Builder
- Singleton
- Abstract Factory
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- Chain of resposibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

# Commits in this repo

Each commit will represent another design pattern.

Idea is to commit once a day everyday through 22 days.

Each commit will include:

- Code example in `src/`
- `doc.md` - about current design pattern
- `img/` - image files for doc.md
- this very file (`design_patterns.md`)

## commit names

Each commit concerns one design pattern so:

`<name.toUpper()> (<group>)`

For example:

`BUILDER (Creational Pattern)`

## sequence

Sequence is based on popularity and my desire to learn concrete design pattern:

- [x] DECORATOR (Structural Pattern)
- [x] OBSERVER (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] SINGLETON (Creational Pattern)
- [ ] STATE (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] ADAPTER (Structural Pattern)
- [ ] STRATEGY (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] BUILDER (Creational Pattern)
- [ ] COMMAND (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] CHAIN OF RESPOSIBILITY (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] PROTOTYPE (Creational Pattern)
- [ ] TEMPLATE METHOD (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] PROXY (Structural Pattern)
- [ ] ITERATOR (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] BRIDGE (Structural Pattern)
- [ ] ABSTRACT FACTORY (Creational Pattern)
- [ ] MEDIATOR (Behavioral Pattern)
- [ ] FACADE (Structural Pattern)
- [ ] MEMENTO (Behavioral Pattern)
